#Simple Linear Regression in Python

This repository contains a simple implementation of linear regression from scratch. The code estimates the relationship between two variables using the least squares method and plots the resulting line along with the data points.

**Overview**
This project demonstrates how to perform linear regression without relying on advanced libraries. The goal is to help users understand the process of estimating the best-fit line for a set of data points and visualizing the result using Python.

**Features**
Coefficient Estimation: Computes the parameters that define the best-fit line for a set of observations.
Data Visualization: Uses Matplotlib to create a scatter plot of the data and display the corresponding regression line.
Educational Value: The code is designed to be easy to understand and modify, making it an excellent resource for learning the basics of linear regression.


**Installation**
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linear-regression.git
cd linear-regression
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:

This project uses NumPy for numerical operations and Matplotlib for plotting. Install them using pip:

bash
Copy
pip install numpy matplotlib
Usage
To run the example implementation, execute the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy
python main.py
The program will display the estimated regression coefficients in the terminal and open a window showing a scatter plot of the data along with the fitted regression line.

**Code Explanation**

Estimating Coefficients:
The program calculates the necessary parameters to determine the best-fit line through a set of data points by considering the relationship between the input and output variables.

Plotting the Regression Line:
It visualizes the original data points as a scatter plot and then draws the regression line on the same plot. The visualization helps in understanding how well the computed line fits the data.

Main Function:
The main function initializes the dataset, computes the regression coefficients, prints them, and then calls the plotting function to display the results.

**Results**
When you run the program, you will see output in the terminal displaying the estimated coefficients for the intercept and slope. Additionally, a plot window will open, showing the data points and the line that best represents the trend in the data.
